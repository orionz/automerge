# Automerge WASM

This is a version of [automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) with the [automerge-rs](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-rs) backend implementation precompiled into WASM and vendored into the package.  It currently only works with node.js as a browser ready version would require the api become async (as browser WASM loads are always ASYNC)
